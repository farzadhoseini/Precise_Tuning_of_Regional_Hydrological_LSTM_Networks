# Precise_Tuning_of_Regional_Hydrological_LSTM_Networks
This code is for paper: "Precise Tuning of Regional Hydrological LSTM Networks: Simultaneous Systematic Random Search Optimization" by F. Hosseini et al. (under review)


This code took advantage of Neuralhydrology python library and model mts-LSTM in the experiments. The library is accessibe in: https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology
